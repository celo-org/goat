# Goat Celo Plugin üêê - TypeScript

The Celo plugin for Goat allows you to create tools for interacting with ERC20 and ERC721 tokens on the Celo blockchain. This includes deploying contracts, transferring tokens, checking balances, minting NFTs, and more.

## Installation

```
npm install @goat-sdk/plugin-celo
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the plugin:

```typescript
import { celoPlugin } from "@goat-sdk/plugin-celo";

const plugin = celoPlugin({
    tokens: [],
});
```

### Adding custom tokens

You can add custom tokens by specifying their details, such as decimals, symbol, name, and contract address for specific chains:

```typescript
import { celoPlugin } from "@goat-sdk/plugin-celo";

const plugin = celoPlugin({
    tokens: [
        {
            decimals: 18,
            symbol: "CELO",
            name: "Celo Native Token",
            chains: {
                "42220": {
                    contractAddress:
                        "0x471EcE3750Da237f93B8E339c536989b8978a438",
                },
            },
        },
        // Add more tokens as needed
    ],
});
```
